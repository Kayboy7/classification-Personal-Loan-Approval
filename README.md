# classification-Personal-Loan-Approval

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I'm tasked with developing a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer based on their financial and demographic information. This project is designed to assess my understanding of classification algorithms, feature engineering, model evaluation, and my ability to derive actionable insights from data.

## **Dataset**

I will be working with a dataset provided in the notebook `bank_personal_loan.csv`, which contains customer information such as age, income, education, and credit card spending. The target variable is `Personal Loan`, which indicates whether a customer accepted the personal loan offer (1) or not (0).
